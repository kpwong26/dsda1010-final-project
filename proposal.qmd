# Project Overview

The goal of my project is to study the impact of the influx in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) on misinformation in newswriting and social media posts. The primary focus of this project is to analyze factors that can flag a news article or social media post as potential AI-generated misinformation. This analysis can help explore potential patterns in content being marked as AI misinformation, and if there is a need for changing current mediawriting structure to avoid this problem.

# Research Questions

List **two specific questions** that your data analysis will answer.

Example:
1. How do housing prices vary across neighborhoods in NYC?
2. What factors are most related to customer satisfaction scores?

### Tip
Good questions are measurable, clear, and require data to answer.
Avoid yes/no questions when possible.

# Data Source

Describe the publicly available data you plan to use.

For each source, include:
- **Name and URL**  
- **What it contains** (variables, number of rows/columns if known)  
- **Why it is useful** for your project  


# Planned Methods

Describe, in a few sentences, how you will analyze and visualize the
data. You don’t need advanced methods---just explain your plan clearly.

Examples:
- Create summary statistics and visualizations to explore trends.  
- Build an interactive dashboard using **R Shiny**.  
- Combine two data sets by a common key (e.g., date or location).

### Tip
It’s okay if your results change later. This section shows that you
have a reasonable plan and motivation.
