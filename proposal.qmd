# Project Overview

The goal of my project is to study the impact of the influx in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) on misinformation in newswriting and social media posts. The primary focus of this project is to analyze factors that can flag a news article or social media post as potential AI-generated misinformation. This analysis can help explore potential patterns in content being marked as AI misinformation, and if there is a need for changing current mediawriting structure to avoid this problem.

# Research Questions

1. What factors are most related to causing text to be marked as AI-generated misinformation?

2. What is the probability that information marked as AI-generated misinformation is actually misinformation?

# Data Source

**Gen AI Misinformation Detection Data (2024-2025)**: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/gen-ai-misinformation-detection-datase-20242025>

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

misinformation_data <- read.csv("generative_ai_misinformation_dataset.csv")

glimpse(misinformation_data)
```

**What it contains**: This dataset contains 500 rows and 31 columns. There are 31 different variables, and each row represents information on a single post/article and if it is misinformation or not.

**Why it is useful**: This dataset is useful for my project because each article/post is identified with a certain model signature, which indicates whether the article/post has been marked as AI-generated or written by a person. The dataset also includes attributes of each article/post. With both of these values, I can compare the attributes of articles/posts marked as AI-generated to those marked as human to explore if there are any patterns for writings being marked as AI-generated and the frequency of misinformation.

# Planned Methods

Describe, in a few sentences, how you will analyze and visualize the
data. You don’t need advanced methods---just explain your plan clearly.

Examples:
- Create summary statistics and visualizations to explore trends.  
- Build an interactive dashboard using **R Shiny**.  
- Combine two data sets by a common key (e.g., date or location).
